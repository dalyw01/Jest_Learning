# Jest Learning

This is a repo from me playing around with Jest for a couple of days

Great place to start is here - 

https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started

## Create folder and package.json

Create a `package.json` like in this repo containing the following

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

## Running Tests

To run tests -

`npm run test`

Any file with the `.test.js`  extension will be executed

## Additional Resources I Found Insightful
